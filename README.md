# Complementary Shaders Lang files
This Repo is **NOT** the source code for [Complementary Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders) for Minecraft, but for the language files only.

I translate the origin English language file (en_US.lang) into the Chinese one (zh_CN.lang). Just download the file and copy into `...\shaders\lang\` folder.

Have fun! :)
